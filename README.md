# Minishell:
It's a core part of the 42 curriculum that involves creating a simplified UNIX shell, helping students deepen their understanding of process management, parsing, signals, and environment variables in C.
The **Minishell** project that developed in C, is a simplified shell that emulates basic behavior of `bash`. It's designed to deepen understanding of:
- Processes and file descriptors
- Parsing complex input (e.g., quotes, pipes, redirections)
- Environment variables and their expansion
- Signal handling
- Built-in commands implementation

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Prompt display and command line input
- ✅ Lexical analysis and parsing
- ✅ Word splitting and quote removal
- ✅ Environment variable expansion (`$VAR`)
- ✅ Redirections: `>`, `>>`, `<`, `<<`
- ✅ Pipes (`|`)
- ✅ Built-in commands:
  - `echo`
  - `cd`
  - `pwd`
  - `export`
  - `unset`
  - `env`
  - `exit`
- ✅ Signal handling (`Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, `Ctrl+\`)
- ✅ Exit codes per POSIX standards
- ✅ Error handling and cleanup

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language:** C
- **Tools:** `readline`, `termios`, POSIX APIs
- **Platform:** Unix/Linux (macOS and Linux compliant)

## 🧠 Learning Goals
Understand how shells work under the hood

Practice managing processes and signals

Implement a tokenizer and parser

Handle memory management manually

Learn to structure a medium-scale C project
